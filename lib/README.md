# Built Libraries Directory

This directory contains the built Godot native libraries generated by the GodotBuilder tool.

## Contents

After running `dotnet run --project GodotBuilder/GodotBuilder.csproj`, this directory will contain:

### Platform-specific Native Libraries

- `linux/` - Linux shared library files (.so)
- `macos/` - macOS dynamic library files (.dylib)  
- `windows/` - Windows DLL files (.dll)

**Note:** GodotSharp C# assemblies are output to `src/GodotAssemblies/` instead of this directory, making them easier to reference from the example project.

## Usage

These built libraries are committed to the repository so that:

1. **Implementation can continue** without requiring each developer to build Godot from source
2. **CI/CD pipelines** can use the pre-built libraries
3. **Quick setup** for new developers

## Rebuilding

To rebuild the libraries for your platform:

```bash
dotnet run --project GodotBuilder/GodotBuilder.csproj
```

This will:
1. Clone the Godot repository (if needed)
2. Build Godot as a shared library for your current platform
3. Build the Godot editor with Mono support
4. Generate C# glue code
5. Build GodotSharp assemblies
6. Copy all artifacts to their respective directories

**Build time:** 30-60 minutes depending on your system.

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Linux:**
- The builder automatically detects Linux and builds for `platform=linuxbsd`
- Requires: `scons`, `gcc/g++` or `clang`, `python3`, standard build tools
- Outputs: `libgodot.linuxbsd.template_release.x86_64.so` to `lib/linux/`

**Windows:**
- Requires: Visual Studio 2019+ or MinGW-w64
- Outputs: `godot.windows.template_release.x86_64.dll` to `lib/windows/`

**macOS:**
- Requires: Xcode command line tools
- Outputs: `libgodot.macos.template_release.universal.dylib` to `lib/macos/`

## Note

The native library binaries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) may be large. Consider using Git LFS for managing these files in a production repository.
