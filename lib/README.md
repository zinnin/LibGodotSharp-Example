# Built Libraries Directory

This directory contains the built Godot native libraries generated by the GodotBuilder tool.

## Contents

After running `dotnet run --project GodotBuilder/GodotBuilder.csproj`, this directory will contain:

### Platform-specific Native Libraries

- `linux/` - Linux shared library files (.so)
- `macos/` - macOS dynamic library files (.dylib)  
- `windows/` - Windows DLL files (.dll)

**Note:** GodotSharp C# assemblies are output to `src/GodotAssemblies/` instead of this directory, making them easier to reference from the example project.

## Usage

These built libraries are committed to the repository so that:

1. **Implementation can continue** without requiring each developer to build Godot from source
2. **CI/CD pipelines** can use the pre-built libraries
3. **Quick setup** for new developers

## Rebuilding

To rebuild the libraries:

```bash
dotnet run --project GodotBuilder/GodotBuilder.csproj
```

This will take 30-60 minutes as it builds Godot from source.

## Note

The native library binaries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) may be large. Consider using Git LFS for managing these files in a production repository.
